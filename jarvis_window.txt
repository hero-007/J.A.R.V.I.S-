A blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.
Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data.
By design, a blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data.
It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks.
